# wORMhole
## Relational database ORM targeting modern C++

A wormhole is a bridge between two points in spacetime, allowing rapid travel between those two points.  This library represents a bridge between C++ syntax and SQL queries.  Queries can be written directly in C++ code, using the compiler to detect syntax and typographical errors.
